## To run the Baseline classifiers:

- Open the file `Models/Baseline-Classifiers.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook and run all cells.
- When cell 5 is run, you will be prompted to select a text processing method.
- The output will be printed at the bottom.

## To run the CNN classifier:

** Important: the word embedding vector file is too big to upload to GitHub so you will have to download it yourself! Go to https://fasttext.cc/docs/en/english-vectors.html and download the first pre-trained word vector file, `wiki-news-300d-1M.vec.zip`. Place the unzipped file in the `Data/` subdirectory.

- Open the file `Models/CNN-Classifier.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook and run all cells.
- When cell 5 is run, you will be prompted to select a text processing method.
- The output will be printed at the bottom.
